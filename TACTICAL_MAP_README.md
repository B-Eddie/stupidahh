## üéÆ Gameplay Tips

### **For New Players**
1. **Start Low**: Begin on ground level to learn the layout
2. **Use Cover**: Always have an escape route planned
3. **Watch Heights**: Geese can attack from above
4. **Control Center**: The central platform is powerful but exposed
5. **Listen**: Goose voice lines can indicate their position

### **For Advanced Players**
1. **Vertical Control**: Master the multi-level gameplay
2. **Chokepoint Mastery**: Use narrow passages strategically
3. **Flanking Routes**: Learn all the paths around obstacles
4. **Timing**: Coordinate movement with goose cooldowns
5. **Environmental Awareness**: Use lighting and shadows

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Performance Issues**
- Reduce `obstacleDensity` in map configuration
- Lower `platformCount` and `coverCount` values
- Check browser console for rendering warnings

### **Navigation Problems**
- Ensure `platformAware:true` in goose movement
- Check that ramps are properly positioned
- Verify obstacle collision detection

### **Lighting Issues**
- Ensure `tactical-lighting` component is present
- Check that shadows are enabled in renderer
- Verify point light distances and intensities
